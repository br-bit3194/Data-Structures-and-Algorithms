Problem Description
N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accommodate only one mouse.

The positions of Mice are denoted by array A, and the position of holes is denoted by array B.

A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x − 1. Any of these moves consume 1 minute.

Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

-109 <= A[i], B[i] <= 109



Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A.

The second argument is an integer array B.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum time when the last nouse gets inside the holes.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [-4, 2, 3]
 B = [0, -2, 4]
Input 2:

 A = [-2]
 B = [-6]


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 4


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Assign the mouse at position (-4 to -2), (2 to 0) and (3 to 4).
 The number of moves required will be 2, 2 and 1 respectively.
 So, the time taken will be 2.
Explanation 2:

 Assign the mouse at position -2 to -6.
 The number of moves required will be 4.
 So, the time taken will be 4.

class Solution:
	# @param A : list of integers
	# @param B : list of integers
	# @return an integer
	def mice(self, A, B):
        if len(A)==1:
            return abs(A[0]-B[0])

        A = sorted(A)
        B = sorted(B)

        max_time = float("-inf")
        for mice, hole in zip(A,B):
            dist = abs(mice-hole)
            max_time = max(max_time, dist)
        return max_time
