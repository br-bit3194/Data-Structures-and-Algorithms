# Problem Description
# You are given an array A of integers of size N.

# Your task is to find the equilibrium index of the given array

# The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

# If there are no elements that are at lower indexes or at higher indexes, then the corresponding sum of elements is considered as 0.

# Note:

# Array indexing starts from 0.
# If there is no equilibrium index then return -1.
# If there are more than one equilibrium indexes then return the minimum index.


# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 105
# -105 <= A[i] <= 105


# Input Format
# First arugment is an array A .


# Output Format
# Return the equilibrium index of the given array. If no such index is found then return -1.


# Example Input
# Input 1:
# A = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
# Input 2:
# A = [1, 2, 3]

# Example Output
# Output 1:
# 3
# Output 2:
# -1

# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:
# i   Sum of elements at lower indexes    Sum of elements at higher indexes
# 0                   0                                   7
# 1                  -7                                   6
# 2                  -6                                   1
# 3                  -1                                  -1
# 4                   1                                   3
# 5                  -3                                   0
# 6                   0                                   0

# 3 is an equilibrium index, because: 
# A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = A[4] + A[5] + A[6]

# Explanation 2:
# i   Sum of elements at lower indexes    Sum of elements at higher indexes
# 0                   0                                   5
# 1                   1                                   3
# 2                   3                                   0
# Thus, there is no such index.
